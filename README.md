# HR-analytics-Predicting-Resignation-and-Uncover-key-decision-drivers
Analyze a set a Employee HR measures to build a predictive model and detect early signs of resignation risk


This notebook aims to predict employees with the highest risk to resign. The project 'HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance' can be followed on Kaagle with the following challenge to Predict attrition of the valuable employees.

# Dataset
The dataset is available on Kaagle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset). The dataset is composed of key HR information for 1470 employees such as:
- age
- marital status
- years of service
- education
- job level, salary....

It also comprizes information on the employee's motivation, performance, working conditions etc... which can be collected by managers during appraisal and annual reviews.
All in all, the dataset contains 35 KPIs which will be used as features to develop a predictive model for resignation.

For each employee, the dataset indicates whether the employee is still with the company or if the employee left. This is called 'Attrition'. This is the response variable to predict.
